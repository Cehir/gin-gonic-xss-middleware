# README #

Should Probably rename this to xss-mw is currently gin-xss

I think this will work with any framework which uses middleware, try to generalize it.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

>> A note on manually escaping input
>> Writing your own code for escaping input and then properly and consistently applying it is extremely difficult. We do not recommend that you manually escape user-supplied data. Instead, we strongly recommend that you use a templating system or web development framework that provides context-aware auto-escaping.
